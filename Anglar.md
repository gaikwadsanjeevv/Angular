##### NPM (Node Package Manager)
is a tool for managing and installing libraries or packages that you use in your Angular or React project.  
Every Angular or React project needs a set of tools, libraries, and frameworks to work (e.g., Angular framework, React library, testing tools, etc.).
NPM fetches these libraries from its online registry and installs them into your project.  
##### Managing Dependencies  
Each project has a package.json file, which is like a "shopping list" of all the libraries your project uses.  
NPM keeps track of the versions of these libraries and ensures everything is compatible.  
##### Running Scripts  
NPM is also used to run custom or pre-defined tasks, like:  
Starting the development server.  
Building the app for production.  
Running tests.  
##### Updating Dependencies  
NPM makes it easy to update libraries to the latest versions or manage compatibility issues.  
##### Sharing and Publishing  
For developers who create reusable components or tools, NPM allows you to publish your own libraries so others can use them in their projects.

What is Node.js?  
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser.  
Itâ€™s not a programming language or a server by itself. It is based on the V8 JavaScript engine (the one used in Google Chrome) to execute JavaScript on your computer or server.  
In Simple Terms: Think of Node.js as an engine that powers JavaScript to run wherever you want, not just inside a web browser.  
Angular projects use NPM (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js.  
#### Running Angular CLI Commands:  
Angular CLI (ng) is a Node.js-based tool that lets you:  
Create a new Angular project (ng new).  
Serve your project locally during development (ng serve).  
Build your project for production (ng build).  
These commands require Node.js to run.  
got to:  https://angular.io/cli  
> npm install -g @angular/cli

The ng command is part of the Angular CLI and is used to manage, build, and maintain Angular applications efficiently. It simplifies common tasks in Angular development, such as creating a new project, generating components, and serving the application.  
ng is short for Angular, derived from the ng in AngularJS directives like ng-app, ng-model, etc.
It serves as the command-line interface for Angular projects     
> ng new blog  
> cd blog  
> code . //to open in vscode  
> ng serve //will build the project and start running on browser.

> gives the local address to run project.
> When u install a particular version of angular CLI which installs the latest version, you get to see same angular version in package.json file.
> Now if u want to install an older version of angular then you go ahead and first uninstall the npm cli version, and then install the required version as:
> npm install -gangular/cli@10.0.0
