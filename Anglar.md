##### NPM (Node Package Manager)
is a tool for managing and installing libraries or packages that you use in your Angular or React project.  
Every Angular or React project needs a set of tools, libraries, and frameworks to work (e.g., Angular framework, React library, testing tools, etc.).
NPM fetches these libraries from its online registry and installs them into your project.  
##### Managing Dependencies  
Each project has a package.json file, which is like a "shopping list" of all the libraries your project uses.  
NPM keeps track of the versions of these libraries and ensures everything is compatible.  
##### Running Scripts  
NPM is also used to run custom or pre-defined tasks, like:  
Starting the development server.  
Building the app for production.  
Running tests.  
##### Updating Dependencies  
NPM makes it easy to update libraries to the latest versions or manage compatibility issues.  
##### Sharing and Publishing  
For developers who create reusable components or tools, NPM allows you to publish your own libraries so others can use them in their projects.
