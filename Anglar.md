##### JavaScript is a scripting language used to build dynamic and interactive content on websites. It runs in web browsers.  
##### TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds static typing, interfaces, and modern object-oriented features.  
##### Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end web application framework developed by Google for building Single Page Applications (SPAs).  
Angular 2 (released in 2016) is the first version that was completely written in TypeScript.  
MongoDB, Node.js, and Angular we would be using together.  
- MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL (also referred to as a non-relational or document-oriented) database that represents and stores data in JSON-format documents. Relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL represent and store data in tables using rows.  
- In relational databases, each table has a schema that defines the columns and data types for each row in the table. In non-relational or document-oriented databases, there’s no defined schema, and every document can be structured differently. This gives non-relational databases more flexibility with documents. This doesn’t mean that non-relational databases are better than relational databases.
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used for client-side scripting with scripts embedded in a webpage’s HTML.Node.js enables JavaScript to script server-side and potentially produce dynamic web page content before a page is sent to a user’s browser.  
 Before Node.js:
Web development was split between two languages:  
Frontend (browser): JavaScript  
Backend (server): Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.  
This meant developers had to switch between two completely different ecosystems, syntax, and logic.

 After Node.js:  
Node.js allowed JavaScript to run outside the browser, on the server.  
This made it possible to build:  
Frontend using JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue)  
Backend (server-side) using Node.js (Express.js, NestJS, etc.)  
✅ Result:  
You can now build entire full-stack applications using just JavaScript.  

Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for both frontend and backend development, eliminating the need to learn different server-side languages.  
When we set up our API, we’ll be using npm to install some packages that were used to build our Angular application’s API.  

##### Angular provides features for writing modern web applications. These include:  
- A file structure to organize our application  
- A command-line interface that creates files.  
- Modules and components to group our HTML, CSS, and client-side scripting (TypeScript/JavaScript)  
- Forms for gathering user input  
- Services to interact with 3rd party APIs  
- Routing for our application’s various pages.

- Angular is a javascript framework and not an programming language.  
- Like it will provide predefined methods and class for creating API.
