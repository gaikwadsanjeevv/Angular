##### JavaScript is a scripting language used to build dynamic and interactive content on websites. It runs in web browsers.  
##### TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that adds static typing, interfaces, and modern object-oriented features.  
##### Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end web application framework developed by Google for building Single Page Applications (SPAs).  
Angular 2 (released in 2016) is the first version that was completely written in TypeScript.  
MongoDB, Node.js, and Angular we would be using together.  
- MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL (also referred to as a non-relational or document-oriented) database that represents and stores data in JSON-format documents. Relational databases such as Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and PostgreSQL represent and store data in tables using rows.  
- In relational databases, each table has a schema that defines the columns and data types for each row in the table. In non-relational or document-oriented databases, thereâ€™s no defined schema, and every document can be structured differently. This gives non-relational databases more flexibility with documents. This doesnâ€™t mean that non-relational databases are better than relational databases.
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform run-time environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. Historically, JavaScript was used for client-side scripting with scripts embedded in a webpageâ€™s HTML.Node.js enables JavaScript to script server-side and potentially produce dynamic web page content before a page is sent to a userâ€™s browser.  
 Before Node.js:
Web development was split between two languages:  
Frontend (browser): JavaScript  
Backend (server): Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, etc.  
This meant developers had to switch between two completely different ecosystems, syntax, and logic.

 After Node.js:  
Node.js allowed JavaScript to run outside the browser, on the server.  
This made it possible to build:  
Frontend using JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue)  
Backend (server-side) using Node.js (Express.js, NestJS, etc.)  
âœ… Result:  
You can now build entire full-stack applications using just JavaScript.  

Node.js allows JavaScript to be used for both frontend and backend development, eliminating the need to learn different server-side languages.  
When we set up our API, weâ€™ll be using npm to install some packages that were used to build our Angular applicationâ€™s API.  

##### Angular provides features for writing modern web applications. These include:  
- A file structure to organize our application  
- A command-line interface that creates files.  
- Modules and components to group our HTML, CSS, and client-side scripting (TypeScript/JavaScript)  
- Forms for gathering user input  
- Services to interact with 3rd party APIs  
- Routing for our applicationâ€™s various pages.

- Angular is a javascript framework and not an programming language.  
- Like it will provide predefined methods and class for creating API.

### Creating Angular Project.  
- Node JS  
- Angular CLI  
- Creating project  
- Compile and run

#### - Make a new file : ng new angular-ekart
- Run:        'ng serve'

- We are using Angular to generate dynamic content.
- We have app-root component in index.html rendering the template page so if you see App folder you fine 4 important files.
   - app.ts  
   - app.html  
   - app.css  
   - app.spec.ts   //we write here unit test cases.
  ** Value of selector in app.ts file of component can be used as HTML tag. We have a HTML file content and it is rendered on screen.
     "@Component({  
  selector: 'app-root',  
  imports: [RouterOutlet],  
  templateUrl: './app.html',  
  styleUrl: './app.css'  
 
})"  

- So in app.html we tried to render the data dynamically also called data binding.
   <h2>welcome to {{title}}</h2>  
   Here the title is rendered from the app.ts file in class and we can change the value to render on the screen.  
-  â€” in an Angular app, the TypeScript code you write in files like app.ts, app.component.ts, services, etc., gets compiled (transpiled) into JavaScript during the build process, and then this JavaScript is what runs in the browser.
-  Does Type Safety Remain After TypeScript is Converted to JavaScript?  
ðŸ‘‰ No â€” type safety is removed during compilation.
1. TypeScript provides type safety at compile-time (development phase):

##### Folder Structure:  
 - a) Node Module - all 3rd party libraries are stored here. We dont deploy on production server. It is purely for development purpose.
 - if we delete the folder then we can bring back by 'npm install' in terminal and the folder is back with all dependencies required for the project+ Extra other Libraries.    
 - b) So how do we know on which packages the angular project is dependent upon - package.json.
 - It contain dependencies and dev dependencies: Dependencies are those on which our project is directly dependent. While the devdependencies is the angular project is dependent on which we are developing the project may need while developing.
 - c) editorconfig - use to set up team environment. There are rules given by team lead he define the coding rules.
 - d) .gitignore - helps to keep those file and folder which can be ignored in git repo.  
 - d) Example in Temp -  i may keep some info or design so i can ignore this file.
 - f) angular.json - very imp file- contails all confuration of the project.
 - g) package-lock.json- records exact versions of every installed dependencies including its subdependencies and there versions. We may be installing the Angular app in production, integration, development environment so so make sure the all dependencies versions remain same.
    - Development is for local coding and testing with full debugging support. Integration is for QA/testing teams to test features in a shared environment using real APIs.Production is the live version for end users, optimized, secure, and without debugging tools.
 - h) tsconfig.json - contains bunch of setting for the typescript compiler this is responsible to convert to javaScript to compile and run.
 - i) SRC - very important folder.
      - IN angular project we can make multiple application, by default we get one that is App. We have 4 component file making an component. Every angular app must have an 'module and copoment'.
   - j) assest folder we store static public resources like images, document.  
      -
